#### gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools

\* *For those building with a mix of bash and custom tools, Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview
comes with a separate endpoint available via the API called
`gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools`. This endpoint is better at prioritizing
your custom tools (for example `view_file` or `search_code`).*

*Note that while `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools` is optimized for agentic
workflows that use custom tools and bash, you may see quality fluctuations in
some use cases which don't benefit from such tools.*

<br />

The best model in the world for multimodal understanding, and our most powerful
agentic and vibe-coding model yet, delivering richer visuals and deeper
interactivity, all built on a foundation of state-of-the-art reasoning.

## Developer guide

Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite is best at handling straightforward tasks at significant
scale. Here are some use cases best suited for Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite:

- **Translation**: Fast, cheap, high-volume translation, such as processing
  chat messages, reviews, and support tickets at scale. You can use system
  instructions to constrain output to only the translated text with no extra
  commentary:

      text = "Hey, are you down to grab some pizza later? I'm starving!"

      response = client.models.generate_content(
          model="gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview",
          config={
              "system_instruction": "Only output the translated text"
          },
          contents=f"Translate the following text to German: {text}"
      )

      print(response.text)

- **Transcription**: Process recordings, voice notes, or any audio content
  where you need a text transcript without spinning up a separate
  speech-to-text pipeline. Supports multimodal inputs, so you can pass audio
  files directly for transcription:

      # URL = "https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/data/State_of_the_Union_Address_30_January_1961.mp3"

      # Upload the audio file to the GenAI File API
      uploaded_file = client.files.upload(file='sample.mp3')

      prompt = 'Generate a transcript of the audio.'

      response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview",
        contents=[prompt, uploaded_file]
      )

      print(response.text)

- **Lightweight agentic tasks and data extraction**: Entity extraction,
  classification, and lightweight data processing pipelines supported with
  structured JSON output. For example, extracting structured data from an
  e-commerce customer review:

      from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

      prompt = "Analyze the user review and determine the aspect, sentiment score, summary quote, and return risk"
      input_text = "The boots look amazing and the leather is high quality, but they run way too small. I'm sending them back."

      class ReviewAnalysis(BaseModel):
          aspect: str = Field(description="The feature mentioned (e.g., Price, Comfort, Style, Shipping)")
          summary_quote: str = Field(description="The specific phrase from the review about this aspect")
          sentiment_score: int = Field(description="1 to 5 (1=worst, 5=best)")
          is_return_risk: bool = Field(description="True if the user mentions returning the item")

      response = client.models.generate_content(
          model="gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview",
          contents=[prompt, input_text],
          config={
              "response_mime_type": "application/json",
              "response_json_schema": ReviewAnalysis.model_json_schema(),
          },
      )

      print(response.text)

- **Document processing and summarization**: Parse PDFs and return concise
  summaries, like for building a document processing pipeline or quickly
  triaging incoming files:

      import httpx

      # Download a sample PDF document
      doc_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/data/med_gemini.pdf"
      doc_data = httpx.get(doc_url).content

      prompt = "Summarize this document"
      response = client.models.generate_content(
          model="gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview",
          contents=[
              types.Part.from_bytes(
                  data=doc_data,
                  mime_type='application/pdf',
              ),
              prompt
          ]
      )

      print(response.text)

- **Model routing** : Use a low-latency and low-cost model as a classifier that
  routes queries to the appropriate model based on task complexity. This is a
  real pattern in production --- the open-source [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/docs/core/#model-fallback) uses Flash-Lite to
  classify task complexity and route to Flash or Pro accordingly.

      FLASH_MODEL = 'flash'
      PRO_MODEL = 'pro'

      CLASSIFIER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""
      You are a specialized Task Routing AI. Your sole function is to analyze the user's request and classify its complexity. Choose between `{FLASH_MODEL}` (SIMPLE) or `{PRO_MODEL}` (COMPLEX).
      1.  `{FLASH_MODEL}`: A fast, efficient model for simple, well-defined tasks.
      2.  `{PRO_MODEL}`: A powerful, advanced model for complex, open-ended, or multi-step tasks.

      A task is COMPLEX if it meets ONE OR MORE of the following criteria:
      1.  High Operational Complexity (Est. 4+ Steps/Tool Calls)
      2.  Strategic Planning and Conceptual Design
      3.  High Ambiguity or Large Scope
      4.  Deep Debugging and Root Cause Analysis

      A task is SIMPLE if it is highly specific, bounded, and has Low Operational Complexity (Est. 1-3 tool calls).
      """

      user_input = "I'm getting an error 'Cannot read property 'map' of undefined' when I click the save button. Can you fix it?"

      response_schema = {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "reasoning": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A brief, step-by-step explanation for the model choice, referencing the rubric."
          },
          "model_choice": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": [FLASH_MODEL, PRO_MODEL]
          }
        },
        "required": ["reasoning", "model_choice"]
      }

      response = client.models.generate_content(
          model="gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview",
          contents=user_input,
          config={
              "system_instruction": CLASSIFIER_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
              "response_mime_type": "application/json",
              "response_json_schema": response_schema
          },
      )

      print(response.text)

- **Thinking**: For better accuracy for tasks that benefit from step-by-step
  reasoning, configure thinking so the model spends additional compute on
  internal reasoning before producing the final output:

      response = client.models.generate_content(
          model="gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview",
          contents="How does AI work?",
          config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
              thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(thinking_level="high")
          ),
      )

      print(response.text)
